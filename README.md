# my_dotfiles_for_i3wm
my .config files for i3 window manager and polybar on kali linux

Â¿WHAT IS I3WM?
i3 window manager is the mostly simple tilling window manager i found on internet. I use it on my kali linux but maybe this dotfiles can be used on other distros so PLEASE TRY IT ON A VIRTUAL MACHINE FIRST.
